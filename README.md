# PostWize

PostWize was created to simplify the job application process by combining all of your professional resources into one! Users may view their pending applications on sites like as Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn with a few clicks, chat and schedule meetings with recruiters, upload application materials, and monitor forthcoming activities with a customizable calendar.Â  PostWize's front end was developed with bootstrap-styled HTML and custom CSS styles. Django and SQLite were used to build the backend. Figma was used to create the prototype, and Netlify was used to host and distribute the site.
