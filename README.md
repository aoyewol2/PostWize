PostWize was created to simplify the job application process by combining all of your professional resources into one! Users may view their pending applications on sites like as Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn with a few clicks, chat and schedule meetings with recruiters, upload application materials, and monitor forthcoming activities with a customizable calendar.

## Inspiration
As students, we're well acquainted with the stress that comes with applying for jobs. There are so many applications, meeting dates, and documents to keep track of- all that overhead in addition to actually having to prepare for the interview. We began to wonder- is there any way to make this process a little less hectic?

## What it does
PostWize is designed to streamline the job application process by consolidating all your career resources into one! With just a few clicks, users can see their pending applications on sites like Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn, chat and schedule meetings with recruiters, upload application materials, and track upcoming events with a personalized calendar.

## How we built it
The front end of PostWize was built with bootstrap-styled HTML, and custom CSS styles. The backend was built with Django and SQLite. The prototype was designed using Figma, and the site was hosted and deployed with Netlify.

## Challenges we ran into
No one in our group had backend experience before embarking on this project. We had to learn how to use Django with little knowledge of how it works and how it could be integrated with the front end. This meant a steep learning curve and, admittedly, a few more hiccups than we would've liked. We also had slight difficulty implementing APIs. We still managed to learn a lot about backend work, even though we didn't quite connect our backend to the frontend.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created clean, easily navigable pages for our login and our dashboard in a very short span of time. We even managed to add cool features like a working calendar and zoom meetings! We are also proud of all exploring new tools we have never used prior to PostWize.

## What we learned
We know a lot more about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Django after having worked on this project. For a lot of us, this was our first time using new technologies and working with new tools like databases and APIs. Exploring these tools gave us a good sense of what features we want to implement to PostWize in the future!

## What's next for PostWize
In the future, we'd like to finish creating a backend for our site. This would allow for user authentication and the creation of user accounts, and would also give us the space to implement more APIs (i.e. Glassdoor API, Indeed API, etc.)
